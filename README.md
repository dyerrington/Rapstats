# Rapstats
I'm using this repo to store a few notes and code snippets to illustrate a project I'm working on at GA.

## Absract

I want to know if topics or theme found in a broad genre of music, hiphop, are stronger in different regions of the US.  Also, if any correlation exists between groups of artists by topic without region.  The stretch goals I have planned include sentiment analysis, web UI, and additional visuals.

## Data Features

* Topic
* Artist 
* Bio
* Hometown
* Affiliates 
* Top Albums
* Similar artists
* Artists in topic 
* Songs in topic

Last summer I scraped lyrics from a variety of web sources, general artist meta-data (Wikipedia), geolocation of artists, preprocessed quite a bit of data removing stop words.
